## ‚úÖ Interview Topics & Answers

### 1. **How does a decision tree make predictions for classification?**
- **Answer Summary:** 
  A decision tree splits from the root node using the feature with the highest information gain. It continues splitting until reaching homogeneous nodes or stopping criteria (e.g., max depth or min samples per leaf).

---

### 2. **What criteria are used to find the best split?**
- **Answer Summary:** 
  Common criteria: Gini impurity and Information Gain. 
  - Information Gain measures entropy reduction after a split.

---

### 3. **How does Random Forest improve upon a single decision tree?**
- **Answer Summary:**  
  1. Uses **bootstrap sampling** to create different training sets.  
  2. Selects **random feature subsets** for each tree, reducing correlation.

---

### 4. **How does Gradient Boosted Trees differ from Random Forest?**
- **Answer Summary:**  
  - RF builds trees **independently** and averages predictions.  
  - GBT builds trees **sequentially**, each correcting the residuals of the previous.

---

### 5. **Techniques in XGBoost/LightGBM to prevent overfitting?**
- **Answer Summary:**  
  - **XGBoost:**  
    - Second-order Taylor expansion for precise optimization  
    - L1/L2 regularization to penalize complexity  
  - **LightGBM:**  
    - Histogram-based binning for speed  
    - Bucketing features (binned structure)

---

### 6. **What does `learning_rate` do in gradient boosting?**
- **Initial Response:** Not fully known.  
- **Follow-up Explanation:**  
  - Controls how much each tree contributes to the final model  
  - Smaller `learning_rate` = higher bias, lower variance  
  - Larger `learning_rate` = faster learning, risk of overfitting

## üîß Suggestions for Improvement

- Improve precision on technical terms:
  - e.g., ‚Äúbootstrapping‚Äù vs ‚Äúchoosing samples‚Äù
- Study important hyperparameters:
  - `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, etc.
- Understand XGBoost‚Äôs loss/objective function formulation
- Practice tuning models and visualizing trees
- Dive into trade-offs: accuracy vs interpretability, GBT vs RF

---

## üéØ Next Steps

- Continue mock interviews on:
  - Model evaluation (precision, recall, ROC)
  - Neural networks
  - Unsupervised learning
- Hands-on: Try tuning XGBoost and LightGBM on a Kaggle dataset
